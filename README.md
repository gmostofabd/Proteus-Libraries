# Proteus Library

![proteuslogo2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80902421-4440-4199-8832-ccf42d149324) 
Here you will find a collection of Proteus Libraries for Simulation, PCB Footprint, 3D Models and Demo exaples. The most common devices which are not available directly in your Proteus Software.

Proteus is widely used among embedded system developers for its powerful simulation capabilities. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it a go-to solution for both PCB design and circuit simulation. With Proteus, you can easily simulate a variety of electronic circuits and embedded systems, streamlining the development process. In our previous post on LED blinking codes, we demonstrated code simulations using Proteus to showcase its effectiveness in real-time simulation.

Following the highly popular Proteus 7, the platform has evolved with the introduction of Proteus version 8, which brings even more advanced features and improved functionality for modern design and simulation needs. Whether you're working on microcontroller projects, IoT devices, or complex circuit designs, Proteus continues to be a valuable tool in the embedded systems ecosystem.

** What to do?**

You have to put library files to libray files in labcenter/proteus/library that has files with extension "lib" and other files models you have to it to model files labcenter/proteus/models.

Unzip the library folder and open it, and youâ€™ll find some folders and files. The Files Iâ€™ve marked in the screenshot above, are the model files ( .LIB and .IDX ) that weâ€™ll copy and paste for installing the Arduino Proteus Library. Follow the next sectionâ€™s step-by-step installation guide.

# How to Install Proteus Libraries?
Here is a step-by-step guide for installing Arduino Proteus Library in Proteus ISIS.

1- Copy Library Files
After downloading the library folder, unzip it and copy all the ( .LIB and .IDX ) files.

2- Go to the Proteus libraries folder & Paste
Open the installation directory for proteus which is usually as follows:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\DATA\LIBRARY

And paste the files youâ€™ve copied right there.

3- Open Proteus (ISIS) and Test
Itâ€™s now done, and you can open Proteus (ISIS) and create a new project to test the functionality of the Arduino Proteus Library. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll be doing in the next section hereafter.



Proteus Libraries for missing components in database

First of all, download as zip any Proteus Library, letâ€™s use this Vibration Sensor Library for Proteus.

You will get a .rar file after download.

Open this .rar file and you will get three files in it, named as: VibrationSensorTEP.LIB VibrationSensorTEP.IDX VibrationSensorTEP.HEX

These are the library files of this vibration sensor and you have to place these files in the Library folder of your Proteus software.

If you are using Windows 7, 8 or 10 then normally Proteus software is installed in the Program File (x86) folder, but it could be in Program File folder as well.

So, go to your C drive and then in both of these Program File folders, search for Labcenter Electronics. This Labcenter Electronics folder is automatically generated by Proteus software.

Note: Sometimes, it happens that Library folder is hidden, so if you are unable to find your Library folder then check your hidden folders too.


# Proteus Library Simulation Demo
In this example, weâ€™ll test the Arduino Proteus Simulation with an LED blinking example.

Arduino Proteus Simulation Project
Now, letâ€™s create an Arduino Proteus Simulation project in ISIS (v8.13)

Open Proteus ISIS

Create New Project

Create a Schematic With the Default Template
