You can download the Arduino Proteus Library using the link below or the button near the end of this tutorial. And unzip the folder to see its contents, and here is what’s inside.

Unzip the library folder and open it, and you’ll find some folders and files. The Files I’ve marked in the screenshot above, are the model files ( .LIB and .IDX ) that we’ll copy and paste for installing the Arduino Proteus Library. Follow the next section’s step-by-step installation guide.

# How to Install Proteus Libraries?
Here is a step-by-step guide for installing Arduino Proteus Library in Proteus ISIS.

1- Copy Library Files
After downloading the library folder, unzip it and copy all the ( .LIB and .IDX ) files.

2- Go to the Proteus libraries folder & Paste
Open the installation directory for proteus which is usually as follows:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\DATA\LIBRARY

And paste the files you’ve copied right there.

3- Open Proteus (ISIS) and Test
It’s now done, and you can open Proteus (ISIS) and create a new project to test the functionality of the Arduino Proteus Library. And that’s what we’ll be doing in the next section hereafter.


# Proteus Library Simulation Demo
In this example, we’ll test the Arduino Proteus Simulation with an LED blinking example.

Arduino Proteus Simulation Project
Now, let’s create an Arduino Proteus Simulation project in ISIS (v8.13)

Open Proteus ISIS

Create New Project

Create a Schematic With the Default Template
