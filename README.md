Here you will find a collection of Proteus Libraries for Simulation, PCB Footprint, 3D Models and Demo exaples. The most common devices which are not available directly in your Proteus Software.

Proteus is widely used among embedded system developers for its powerful simulation capabilities. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it a go-to solution for both PCB design and circuit simulation. With Proteus, you can easily simulate a variety of electronic circuits and embedded systems, streamlining the development process. In our previous post on LED blinking codes, we demonstrated code simulations using Proteus to showcase its effectiveness in real-time simulation.

Following the highly popular Proteus 7, the platform has evolved with the introduction of Proteus version 8, which brings even more advanced features and improved functionality for modern design and simulation needs. Whether you're working on microcontroller projects, IoT devices, or complex circuit designs, Proteus continues to be a valuable tool in the embedded systems ecosystem.

** What to do?**

You have to put library files to libray files in labcenter/proteus/library that has files with extension "lib" and other files models you have to it to model files labcenter/proteus/models.

Unzip the library folder and open it, and youâ€™ll find some folders and files. The Files Iâ€™ve marked in the screenshot above, are the model files ( .LIB and .IDX ) that weâ€™ll copy and paste for installing the Arduino Proteus Library. Follow the next sectionâ€™s step-by-step installation guide.

***How to Install Proteus Library
**Extract Library Files:
After downloading the library folder, unzip it and copy all the ( .LIB and .IDX ) files.
Open the .zip file containing the model library.

**Extract the contents, typically finding folder like LIB.

**Locate Proteus Library Folder:
Identify your Proteus library folder on your computer. The default location may vary based on your Proteus software version.
For Proteus 8 Professional, itâ€™s often found at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\DATA\LIBRARY

** Copy LIB Files:
Open the LIB folder extracted from the model library.
Copy the files within the LIB folder.
Paste these files into your Proteus Library Folder.

** Alternative DATA Folder Location:
For certain Proteus versions, you might locate the DATA folder in a different path, such as:
C:\ProgramData\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\DATA
Note: The ProgramData folder could be hidden, so unhide it if needed.

After copying the library files, restart Proteus to apply the changes. Open Proteus and navigate to the Pick Device Window. Confirm that the added model(s) are available for easy selection and integration into your projects.


** Open Proteus (ISIS) and Test
Itâ€™s now done, and you can open Proteus (ISIS) and create a new project to test the functionality of the Arduino Proteus Library. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll be doing in the next section hereafter.

Note: Sometimes, it happens that Library folder is hidden, so if you are unable to find your Library folder then check your hidden folders too.


# Proteus Library Simulation Demo
In this example, weâ€™ll test the Arduino Proteus Simulation with an LED blinking example.

Arduino Proteus Simulation Project
Now, letâ€™s create an Arduino Proteus Simulation project in ISIS (v8.13)
